Zomato Ratings Analysis:

1. First I have analyzed the dataset of the restaurants of Bengaluru for different factors affecting the ratings.
2. Then I created a ML model to predict the rating given different factors.
3. Then I created a Flask app to use the model with a front end.Here the user can enter numeric values related to every factor value and then get the expected rating.
